    			<p>I sprang from my mothers womb decades ago in a city even hotter than this scorching desert: Palm Springs, Ca. A city filled with gays, old people, and old gays. This is why you can catch me at any gay bar or early bird special in town, but make no mistake gentlemen I am straight. At 10 yrs old, my mom enrolled me in ballet to turn me into a lady, but it didn't work. Instead, I got my first taste of metal hearing Rammensteins Du Hast during a break in class. It was like seeing a unicorn mating with a Pegasus. I have been rocking at Warped Tour, Coachellafest and every hardcore show I could in SoCal. I came to finish school at NMSU because I wasnt into selling my body on a street corner to afford college in California. Being loud and talkative didnt make me a good server, but it did help catch Courtney Nelsons ear when he came in. Instead of being a bad tipper, he offered an internship working at the most kick ass radio station, KLAQ. From there, Kevin Vargas added me on to the Morning Show to harass Buzz Adams everyday. Games On!!!
