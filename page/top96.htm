            <p>"Drown" is a song by the British rock band Bring Me the Horizon on October 21, 2014. Originally released as a stand alone single, a re-recorded version features on the band's fifth studio album That's the Spirit. The track, musically, marks a shift away from the band's previously established metalcore sound. Rather, it was described by critics as other types of rock, including alternative rock, emo, and pop punk, also being described as "arena rock fire".</p>
